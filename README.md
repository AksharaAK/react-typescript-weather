# TypeScript Weather API

---

## Description

I come from a tropical country, a coastal city which is hot and humid throughout the year. Here in the UK, I've realised that weather plays a a crucial role in every social interaction. I love the marked difference in the seasons and can't wait for the longer, sunnier days. Here's my custom Weather App using the OpenWeather API.

This project is inspired by [Weather App](https://theultimateapichallenge.com/weather-typescript-api) by Daniela Fedyakin where she uses the OpenWeather API as part of The Ultimate API Challenge.

My focus in this project is to build a Typescript React app using Tailwind for styling.
